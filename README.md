numbers_from_tweets
===================

given input as raw twitter data in json format, this code will do the following:
- strip entities from the tweet (hashtags, url, @username mentions)
- print each number from the tweet on its own line

Entity mentions are stripped using data from twitter's supplied entities, including start/end position. Although I haven't measured the performance, it should be faster than performing multiple regex substitutions against each tweet.
